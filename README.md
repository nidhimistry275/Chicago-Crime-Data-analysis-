## Final Group Project of IFT 533: Data Visualization & Reporting for IT

## Dataset 
The selected dataset provides a complete history of Chicago crime reports from 2010 to the present, excluding data from the previous week. The Chicago Police Department uses the CLEAR system to gather its data. The set of data gives location information at the block level without identifying specific addresses to protect the confidentiality of crime victims. This is a precautionary step for privacy issues. Analysts and academics can use this dataset to spot patterns in crime, create plans for preventing it, and carry out different socio-economic analyses while maintaining the privacy of those engaged.
